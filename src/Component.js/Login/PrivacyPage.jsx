            <p>
              This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Vehicle Bells, Inc.
              ("Company" or "Vehicle Bells" or "we" or "our" or "us") treats
              information collected or provided in connection with an end user's
              ("you" or "your" or "User") use of the Vehicle Bells mobile device
              software application ("App") and the Vehicle Bells website located
              at https://www.vehiclebells.com/ (the "Online Service" and
              together with the App, the "Services"). The Service is used by
              Users to keep track of and analyze the User's activities with one
              or more service providers and their potential tax impact (each a
              "Provider"). Please note that your use of the Services constitutes
              your acceptance of this Policy as set forth below.

            <h2>Provision of Third Party Credentials</h2>
            <p>
              In order for us to provide the Services to you, we may ask that
              you (i) provide us with log-in credentials to your Provider
              accounts so that we can access and use your Provider account
              information as described in this Policy and/or (ii) provide us
              with your email credentials so that we may access the emails a
              Provider sends to such email account and use such email content as
              described in this Policy. If you do not consent to our access to
              these accounts or these credentials, please do not use the
              Services. Such credentials may be subject to unauthorized access
              and use despite Vehicle Bells' use of reasonable security
              measures, as no security measures are 100% effective. Vehicle
              Bells recommends that you do not provide Vehicle Bells with log-in
              credentials for any email account that you use for purposes other
              than your Provider relationships. In particular, Vehicle Bells
              does not recommend that you provide Vehicle Bells, or any third
              party, with log-in credentials for an e-mail account that you use
              in connection with any financial accounts, health data
              repositories, or other services through which sensitive
              information may be obtained. There are many free services (such as
              Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Hotmail) through which you may create an
              e-mail account that you use only for purposes of your Provider
              relationships and your use of the Services.

            <h2>Collected Information</h2>
            <p>
              The information collected during your use of the Services includes
              the following:{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              (a) Submitted Information. As part of using the Services, you may
              submit certain information to us. For example, when you register
              for an account on the Services, we will collect information from
              you, including Personal Information such as your first and last
              name, phone number, a photo that you upload, and an email address.
              "Personal Information" means information such as a name or email
              address that we can directly associate with a specific person or
              entity without additional information. To the extent you decline
              to share certain information with us, we may not be able to
              provide some or all of the features and functionalities found on
              the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              (b) Provider Data. To provide you with the Services, we will use
              the log-in credentials you provide to review the contents of
              emails in your email accounts relating to your activities and
              transactions with Providers as well as information available
              through your Provider accounts relating to activities and
              transactions with that Provider. By way of example only, this
              information may include the number of miles driven over a given
              time, the amount of payments received from the Provider per task,
              or the number of times you worked with that Provider over a given
              period. We may analyze this information to come up with meaningful
              analysis of this data, such as the average amount of money earned
              per trip for the Provider or which times engaging for the Provider
              gives you the most payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              (c) Automatically Collected Information. When you use the
              Services, we gather certain non-personally identifiable
              information from you, and this information can be associated with
              your user account. This includes usage information, such as
              information on when, how often and for how long you use the Online
              Service, as well as server log data such as a computer’s IP
              address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you
              came to the Online Service. We also collect information about the
              time and location you used the Store Service and the amount of
              change you added or redeemed.
            </p>
            <p>
              (d) Tracking and Cookies. The Services may use both web beacons
              and cookies to collect information. “Beacons” (also often referred
              to as “pixels”) are tiny graphics on a web page designed to track
              when a page is viewed. “Cookies” are small text files containing a
              string of alphanumeric characters that are downloaded by your web
              browser or mobile device when you visit a website. We may use both
              session cookies and persistent cookies when you access and use the
              Services. Cookies may be used, for example, to remember your user
              account information and your preferences, to customize the
              interface of the Services for you and to assist us in measuring
              and analyzing Service traffic. A session cookie disappears after
              you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you
              close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent
              visits to the Services. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please
              review your browser’s documentation to learn the best way to
              modify your cookie settings. Like many websites, the Services does
              not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. However,
              you can take steps to limit tracking by erasing cookies from your
              computer’s hard drive and by setting your browser to block all
              cookies or warn you before a cookie is stored.
            </p>
            <p>
              (e) Analytics. We use certain third party services to assist us in
              analysis, auditing, research, and reporting regarding the
              Services. These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and
              they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.
              In particular, we use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze
              certain information for the purposes discussed in this Policy. You
              may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics at Vehicle
              Bells
            </p>
            <p>
              (f) Location-Based Information. If you allow location-based
              tracking through your mobile device and App preferences, we will
              receive information regarding your precise location (using the GPS
              antenna within your device) when the App is running on your
              device. We also receive information from the compass on your
              mobile device, including course, velocity and altitude.
            </p>
            <p>

              Provider per task. We use this information to analyze the data and
